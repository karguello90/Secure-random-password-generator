Challenge 03 - Create a random password generator

About: 

The goal of the project was to use JavaScript fundamentals to create a password generator. 

Through the use of prompts, the site asks a series of criteria questions that determine the final random secure password 
(what will be password length, and allows to user select if they would like numbers, symbols and upper and lower case letters)

The use of alerts, parameters, and if statements, ensures that the password meets the minimum criteria requirements.

If the createria requirements have not been met, the user will be alerted to
restart the password length and criteria questionnaire, until the criteria requirements are satisfied.

The end result is a site enables the user to create a randomized password that is customized to their liking.

The completed site can be found here:
